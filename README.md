## About the project


This is my first ever Spring Boot application. After hearing good things about the Spring framework, I decided to try it out. 

This project was made with the help of [Feltex](https://www.youtube.com/@FeltexBr)'s video series about Spring Boot, which I super recommend for anyone starting!

It covers topics such as: OOP, Docker, REST APIs, CRUD and more. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did ;)
